# School

### Website for automation school processes

## Prerequisites

## Install
- Python: 3.9.1
- Docker Desktop - [Download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Steps

- Clone the current github folder
- Create a virtual environment (Do not forget to activate it)
- Go to the directory with "docker-compose.yml" file
- Open a command line there and run "docker-compose up"
	* if it will show some errors and does nothing. Press “CTRL + C” and type again “docker-compose up”. It happens because school_web starts before database is fully finished.
